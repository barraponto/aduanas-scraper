# Scraping DUAs 

## Installation

Follow installation instructions for Scrapy.

## Running

Pass a DUAs url listing (generated by `03-duas.js`) as a scrapy crawl parameter:

    scrapy crawl -a urls=../DUAs/partida-0402211000.txt -o duas-0402211000.csv

The data source will ban you after X (between 100-500) requests.
If you need to run this script often or for many separate DUAs, try setting up Tor or Crawlera.
